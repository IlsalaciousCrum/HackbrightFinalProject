Hello!
{{ friend.first_name}} {{ friend.last_name  }} - ({{  friend.email  }}) would like to 
connect with you on KindTable.

KindTable is a webapp I made that organizes dietary information such as diet (ex: vegan, paleo, vegetarian),
allergies/intolerances (ex: gluten, peanut) and ingredients to avoid (ex: red pepper, pork) and helps
the host pick recipes that will work for everyone invited to a meal.

Step One:

Register at Kind Table. Complete a quick registration process to provide your dietary information. Don't have
any dietary preferences? The process will be even quicker. :)
