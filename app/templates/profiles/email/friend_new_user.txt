Hello!

KindTable is a webapp that organizes dietary information such as diet (ex: vegan, paleo, vegetarian),
allergies/intolerances (ex: gluten, peanut) and ingredients to avoid (ex: red pepper, pork) and helps
the host pick recipes that will work for everyone invited to a meal.

To become friends with {{ friend.first_name}} {{ friend.last_name  }}({{  friend.email  }}), follow

Don't want to use KindTable to organize your own dinner parties? Ignore the confirmation email that follows
